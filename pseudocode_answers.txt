SHORT ANSWER
Why do programmers use pseudocode?
    it helps them get there thoughts organized without having to create workable code as they do it.

If you run pseudocode on your computer what would happen?
    Nothing, it is meant for humans to read, not machine.


PROGRAMMING ASSIGNMENT
Create a function that takes two numbers and prints out the greater number.
    INPUT first number
    INPUT second number
    IF the first number is greater than the second number THEN
        return the first number
    ELSE 
        return the second number
    END IF

Create a function that prints out the numbers from 1 to 100.
    INIT total to 0
    WHILE the total is less than 100
        ADD one to total
        PRINT total
    END WHILE

Create a function that searches for a specific entry in a phonebook.
    INPUT entry
    FILTER through phonebook to find a match for entry and store value in variable result
    return result



Using the pseudocode you wrote for the previous question, implement it in any computer language of your choice.
    var entry = userentry
    const result = phonebook.filter(entry => entry === phonebook.entry)
    return result
