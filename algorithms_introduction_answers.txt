Using proper pseudo-code, describe the following primitive algorithms:

    Making coffee;
        A:
        IF you do not own a coffee maker, buy a coffee maker
        IF you do not own coffee grounds, buy coffee grounds
        IF you do not own coffee filters, buy coffee filters

        Retrieve one coffee filters
        Place coffee filter in the coffee filter basket
        Retrieve half a cup of coffee grounds
        place coffee grounds on top of the filter
        Pour 4 cups of water into the coffee maker
        Close all compartments on your coffee maker
        Press the start button to make the coffee

    Washing dishes;
        A: 
        Turn on the kitchen faucet
        adjust water temperature to be warm
        While you one or more dirty dishes
            grab the nearest dirty dishes
            place dish under the flow of water for a few seconds
            remove dish from the flow of water
            apply light soap to the dish
            scrub dish with a sponge until all noticable food is removed
            place back under the flow of water until all soap is removed
            remove from the flow of water
            dry dish off
            place dish in a stack of clean dishes
        end While
        place all clean dishes in their appropriate places in the kitchen

    A choice of your own.
        A: Walking up stairs
        While you are not at the top of the stairs
            Place the left foot on top of the nearest step
            place the right foot at the top of the nearest step
        end while loop

Name three companies who created an algorithm that made them successful
    1) Berkshire and Hathaway - They have an algorithm for investing which has made them one of the wealthiest companies in the world.
    2) The Wright Brothers - Created an algorithm to make man made flight a possibility
    3) Ford Motor Company - Created an algorithm to design and manufacture cars for cheap

3) An effective algorithm it logical, crystal clear in their steps, and can be completed in a finite amount of time.
